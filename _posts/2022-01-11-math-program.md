# Math Cognition UCSF 

We are a multidisciplinary team studying the neural architecture and dynamics of human intelligence, with a focus on cognitive symbolic systems such as **mathematics** and **language**. Our research program aims at understanding how these systems develop and decline, and how we can help.

We combine machine learning **computational modeling**, **electrophysiological recordings** (intracranial EEG, MEG), **neuroimaging** (fMRI), **continuous behavioral measures** (trajectory-tracking), and **neuropsychology** to study the processing stages and representational codes underlying cognitive operations. Complementarily, we use intracranial electrical stimulation to modulate brain activity and behavior.

* Our core members are:
* [Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas, PhD](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVsftdsAAAAJ&hl) - PI Assistant Professor UCSF
* [Betinna Pedemonte, PhD](https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/bettina-pedemonte) - Math Specialist UCSF
* [Margo Kersey](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/margo.kersey) - aCRC UCSF
* [Rian Bogley](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/rian.bogley) - Database Architect UCSF


We are part of UCSF Neurology (Memory and Aging Center) and Neurosurgery departments and we collaborate with several labs and initiatives:
* [UCSF Dyslexia Center](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF)
* [ALBA Lab](https://albalab.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF)
* [Multitudes](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/multitudes-partners) (UCSF)
* [Chang Lab](https://changlab.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF)
* [CAN Lab](https://canlab.ucsf.edu/) (UCSF)
* [Computational and Language Lab](http://colala.berkeley.edu/) (UC Berkeley) 
* [NoCe Lab](https://noce-lab.github.io/) (Universit√© de Gen√®ve)

Our current projects are:
* Logical primitives of symbolic reasoning
* Neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the co-occurence of Dyslexia and Dyscalculia
* [NeuroCausal - an open data sharing and metadata synthesis platform for clinical data](https://neurocausal.github.io/)
* A machine learning framework for classifying and predicting neurodevelopmental disorders
* Behavioral and neurological signatures of math deficits in primary progressive aphasia 
* [A novel approach to subtypes of developmental dyscalculia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=XVsftdsAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=XVsftdsAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC)
* Neurophysiological basis of math anxiety

We are active participants of initiatives to promote **open, inclusive, and reproducible science**: 
* [Brainhack: Developing a culture of open, inclusive, community-driven neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.04.001). 
* [Gender bias in academia: A lifetime problem that needs solutions](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.06.002)

Because of the interdisciplinary nature of our research program, we have developed and improved methods to measure behavior and model brain activity. All methods are **open source and publicly available**, notably: 
* [Trajectory tracking](https://trajtracker.com/)
* [iEEG preprocessing and analysis toolbox](https://github.com/pinheirochagas/lbcn_preproc)
* [Methods for MEG multivariate decoding](https://github.com/pinheirochagas/Calc_MEG)
* [Toolbox to convert iEEG data into the Neurodata Without Borders data standard](https://github.com/pinheirochagas/lbcn_nwb)
